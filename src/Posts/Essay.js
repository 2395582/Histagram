       <h1><em>Indirect Flights</em>: A Critical Analysis</h1>
      <h2>A Brief Description</h2>
      <p><em>“Hamilton fashions a digital layer cake of satellite images, photographs, organic textures
              such as brushstrokes, and raw materials like rocks and chain link fence, forming it into an
              endless, navigable loop with something close to three-dimensionality.”</em> (Pangburn, 2015)
      </p>
      <p>
      This is one of the descriptions of Joe Hamilton’s Internet Art titled:<em>Indirect Flights</em> (2015). 
      The artwork is an interactive piece which Hamilton worked on during a three-month
      residency with the Moving Museum (Rainforth, 2015). It is, in effect, Hamilton’s response to
      the phenomenon achieved by widespread internet usage which allows most everybody the
      ability to “experience a global perspective of the world.” (Hamilton, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
      It's no surprise then, given this was the artist’s intentions, that the artwork itself gives the
      illusion of looking at the world through a window from on high. The viewer is able to pan
      across this representation on a global scale, moving across various aforementioned obstacles
      (chain link fences and rocks amongst others). This creates an effect of looking at the world
      through a series of barriers, barriers which can be historically seen as physical barriers
      barring travel (chain link fences don’t exactly radiate a welcome attitude).
      </p>
      <p>
      Despite these “barriers”, viewers are still able to see much of the world as Hamilton has
      sculpted it. This is where, I believe, the effect of the internet is truly brought to life in the
      artwork. With a proverbial click of a button (it’s actually the scroll of a mouse, but that’s just
      semantics) the viewer is able to move past these obstacles and catch glimpses of the world
      beyond. A seamless world of blue, green, and most other colours one would expect to see
      when viewing the world from this height. This seamless, homogenized world, ironically, is at
      odds with the dissimilar nature of the “barriers”. This creates an artwork which is
      simultaneously seamless, as well as it’s opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
      The interaction provided by Hamilton, is by no means arbitrary. As I have mentioned, the
      viewer is able to pan across barriers to catch glimpses of the world beyond. This further
      aligns with the artists intentions of showing the relation between advancing technology and
      the experience of a global perspective of the world. Through internet, and more specifically,
      through interaction, the viewer is able to skirt past these barriers, and fulfil their artist allotted
      destiny of experiencing the world through a global perspective.      
      </p>
      <h2>Internet Art</h2>
      <p>
        <em>
         “The next generation of artists will very likely work for the internet more than for the aura of
         the original.”
        </em> (Carrier, 2020)
      </p>
      <p>
      So, Carrier said in response to Benjamin’s <em>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical
      Reproduction</em> (1936), where Benjamin exults and accentuates the quality of “aura” in a work
      of art. This in an age where works of art are subject to rapid and widespread reproduction.
      Old Benji would probably have a fit if he saw the internet as it now stands, where rapid and
      widespread reproduction are the norm.
      </p>
      <p>
      Thus, Carrier’s response. “…work for the internet…” (Carrier, 2020). Internet Art is very
      much about artists working for the internet. And with the internet. And on the internet. Or as
      Ricci put it:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>“…a form of art specifically conceived through the internet, on the internet, and for the
internet.”</em> (Ricci, 2020)
      </p>
      <p>
      Internet art is an artform which erupted early on in days of the internet. It is, in my opinion,
the natural response to the internet as a tool. (Use it to make art.) I say natural, because all the
artforms we enjoy today, stemmed from similar roots. We made clothes to cover our bodies,
and it was only a matter of time before we made fashion. We made the internet, to share
knowledge and connect people. It was only a matter of time before we used it to make art.
      </p>
      <p>
      Internet art’s “rules” are as open ended as the platform it takes its name from. Internet art, as
far as I can tell, needs to be made using the internet, available on the internet, and impossible
to replicate without the internet. This, I believe, is a pretty good foundation to begin with,
when taking the path (path not found) of internet art.
      </p>
      <p>
      A large number of internet artworks are in response to the internet. (Very META). This is
true for <em>Indirect Flights</em> (Hamilton, 2015). Using the internet, Hamilton responds to the
internet, then makes this artwork available on the internet. Needless to say, this artwork is
impossible to replicate without the internet, both as a medium, and as an inspiration to the
artwork. This subtext lends the artwork as many layers as the artist himself did, and further
enriches the decidedly enriched experience.
      </p>
      <h2>
      Critical Analysis.
      </h2>
      <p>
      Aesthetically, <em>Indirect Flights</em> (2015) is… interesting to view. It reminds me of this image,
which went viral on twitter a while ago:
      </p>
      <img src={Eyesore}/>
      <p>Can you name one thing in this picture?</p>
      <p>
      Was the challenge affixed to the post. This eyesore was pored over by hundreds, most having
the same response as you or me: I have no idea what’s going on here. I experienced a similar
reaction when first viewing Hamilton’s artwork. At first glance, it is decidedly tricky to
figure out exactly what one is looking at. Then you pan across the screen. And it doesn’t get
any easier. But as your eyes adjust to “satellite vision” more and more things start poking out
at you. Like a “How many animals can you find?” puzzle. A dam here, a mountain range
there. All fused together. The overlapping images also lend the artwork a sense of depth,
which further pushes the “satellite effect”.
      </p>
      <p>
      So, while the artwork is confusing to look at, this does not take from its aesthetic prowess.
The “global perspective” that Hamilton affords is just that, global. Large scale, and much
more easily viewed in smaller squares at a time. Which brings us to the interactivity aspect of
the artwork.
      </p>
      <p>
      Internet artworks, all have an element of interactivity to them. As one would expect from an
art form dependant on the internet. <em>Indirect Flights</em> (2015) interactivity, as I have mentioned
is not in the least bit arbitrary. Not only does it afford the viewer the aesthetic advantage of
perusing smaller parts of an entire artwork at their leisure, but it also allows the user to experience the phenomenon at the root of the artwork. In this way, Hamilton wields
interaction in internet art as a double edged sword, allowing it to add both to the aesthetic
experience, but also the overall experience of the artwork. In achieving this, Hamilton makes
good on his intention to provide people with an opportunity to “experience a global
perspective of the world.” (Hamilton, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
      No critical analysis of an artwork would be complete without a philosophical deep dive into
the symbolism present in the artwork at hand. The artwork, Indirect Flights (2015) is chock
full of symbolism, inspired by the words quoted above. In order to afford viewers this global
perspective, Hamilton crafted a homogenous collage of satellite imagery and photographs,
overlayed with an equally homogenous, if sparse, collage of rocks, brick, brush strokes and
chain link fences.
      </p>
      <p>
      These, as I have mentioned, work as a barrier to the brilliantly crafted world view available
beyond it. This, I believe, is a play on the quality of the internet to remove physical barriers
and allow widespread exploration of the world on a global scale. This “removal of barriers”
though an ethereal quality of the internet, is rendered physical in the artwork through the
simple and highly effective interaction that Hamilton affords.
      </p>
      <p>
      This elevates the artwork, indeed making it a masterclass in internet art, in my humble
(WARNING) opinion. The artwork plays so well with the ideas that Hamilton proposes, and
without text or instruction, the determined viewer can find this out all for themselves through
careful and exciting perusal of the artwork. Very Nice!
      </p>
      <p>
      In conclusion, <em>Indirect Flights</em> (2015) is an exceptional example of internet art. Hamilton
weaves a fanciful collage of images together, along with a deep, meaningful, impactful,
message. The artwork comes alive at the viewers touch, offering scenes which are not just
visually appealing, but impressive. A view, which without the internet would be reserved to
astronauts, and flying pieces of metal above us, is made available, artistically, to everyone. A
true case of the artist working for the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
      Hamilton uses the internet as a medium, both literally – through the use of sourced images,
and the actual hosting and widespread distribution of the artwork – and figuratively – through
the symbolic representations of phenomena borne from this Internet Age. The phenomenon
of widespread availability to the world on a global scale. This is an element of the internet
that never fails to amaze me. The world at your fingertips. No exaggeration or hyperbole
needed to make that statement more impressive.
      </p>
      <p>
      This, I believe, is what drew me to this artwork. From my decidedly confused first
impression, to my eventual appreciation of the artwork on several levels, the indirect flight
offered to me by Hamilton was first class.
