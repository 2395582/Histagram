     <h1>Rationale for Webart (+New Rationale!)</h1>
     <p>
     My proposed Internet Artwork will take on the form of an Instagram feed… from the Sixties. A combination of art and history (or rather, the telling of history in a narrative form), the feed will include posts from important socio-cultural icons in the 1960’s. As well as the time period, I will also be focusing on America, during this time, simply because it is a period, and place in history that I am interested in.
     </p>
     <p>
     The rationale for this IA is quite tricky. It is a combination (unholy perhaps) of history, art, and the internet. So  not that tricky, actually.
     </p>
     <p>
     Art and history, have an obvious correlation (check out my independent research for more!) and the use of art to teach/portray history is common enough. From artistically impressive documentaries to period pieces (movies & literature) an artistic portrayal of history, and historical figures/events is something I’m sure you’ve interacted with. And now that “interaction” just got better.
     </p>
     <p>
     Ever wondered what Instagram would look like in the Sixties? What would Frank Sinatra post? JFK? Sharon Tate? Well stop wondering, and start scrolling. Introducing Histagram! (Coming Soon)
     </p>
     <p>
     This would be the tagline of the website. Histagram, because Instagram uses “Insta” as in “Instant” and “Hista” because it’s history. (I don’t think I needed to explain that) The site offers a new, innovative portrayal of history, bringing historical figures to life for your entertainment. (So basically Night at the Museum, but for Instagram) The bizarre combination of old-fashioned icons mixed with contemporary social media, is a pull I cannot resist. (Hopefully you can’t either!)
     </p>
     <p>Here is the new content for this rationale.</p>
     <p>
     I think I was successful in painting a portrait of what a contemporary social media feed would look like in the 1960’s. There is, of course, a lot more that could be added, and given the time, this could be a huge project, and I believe an interesting, and interactive way of educating people about history.
     </p>
     <p>
     The bits I decided to focus on, were stuff that interested me, first of all. This may be self-indulgent, but what art isn’t, at some level. This is why I included posts on Sinatra, and The Beatles.
     </p>
     <p>
     The other events were of cultural significance, and some of the heavy-hitting cultural comets, which shook the world at the time.
     </p>
     <p>
     I would like to give a quick breakdown of each post, for further information:
     </p>
     <p>
     The first post, is the instantly recognizable image of Martin Luther King Jr. as he addressed 1000’s and gave his famous, hair-raising speech; “I have a dream” in which he spoke of a dream of a better America. A huge moment in the Civil Rights Movement in America at the time, and one that we would do well to remember I believe.
     </p>
     <p>
     I felt this was a post that he would make, meaning that in the most respectful way possible. (The same can be said for all the posts made, I intend no ill will on any of the personalities I have chosen to represent… except Charles Manson)
     </p>
     <p>
     The second post is a bit tongue-in-cheek, and shows an image of the much loved, then POTUS, announcing that he will “Be in Dallas tomorrow”. That next day, in Dallas, JFK was assassinated.
     </p>
     <p>
     The third post celebrates, the “British Invasion” which referred to the huge cultural impact The Beatles had on USA, and the world at large. The post shows their first US album release.
     </p>
     <p>
     The fourth is Frank Sinatra, promoting his latest album in which he collaborated with the famous Count Basie. Frank Sinatra, though past his prime, managed to hold on quite well in the sixties, despite the rapidly changing taste in music. 
     </p>
     <p>
     The fifth, is another post of The Beatles promoting an album. This is also my favorite Beatles album, so I found it hard not to include it.
     </p>
     <p>
     The sixth is Frank Sinatra posting on his birthday, a picture of him in his younger days. In his old age he grew quite fond of thinking about old age, and the way life goes by, having several songs dedicated to the phenomenon. I would recommend “September of my Years”.
     </p>
     <p>
     The sixth celebrates the release of a huge, culturally significant movie.
     </p>
     <p>
     The seventh is once again Sinatra, who posts an awful lot for an old man. The caption is inspired by a line he delivered while performing at The Sands hotel in Las Vegas.
     </p>
     <p>
     The next four posts tell the story, very concisely, of Sharon Tate. From young, beautiful, budding actress, to marrying one of the hottest directors in town (in terms of talent. Also, I understand that Polanski is quite problematic, and this is by no way an acceptance of his behavior). After this, there is a post of Charles Manson, a cult man, who is most famous for orchestrating the murders of Sharon and some friends on the 9th of August. The last post in this story, indicates that Sharon is looking to enjoy a quiet night with friends on the 9th of August, which is unfortunately the night she was tragically murdered.
     </p>
     <p>
     The last post is one of Woodstock, a huge concert which occurred at the end of the 60’s.
     </p>
     <p>
     A lot of the internet art I’ve seen has been abstract, and somewhat weird. This is a quality which I enjoy, and definitely find interesting, but I have always been more inclined to make art of a more “formal” kind. This is why this idea, when I got it, stuck with me. I am happy with the results, and though I realize I could have done more, I think with the constraints I had, this is a good effort.
